	QUESTION:
	Is it possible to request the data from a different origin (e.g., 
	http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/) or from your local machine (from file:///) 
	from using XMLHttpRequest? Why or why not?

	It is possible to request the data from a different origin such as,
	http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/, because the same-origin applies to the case.
	However, it is not possible to request the data from my local machine because
	not only we can't reach to someone else's local files, but also it's not the 
	same origin as the website that we are using.
